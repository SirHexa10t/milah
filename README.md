# milah
Hebrew Wordle

"Mila" means "word".

"Mila-h" means "filled" (in the past, action done by female form), but it's more of an attempt to twist the word "word" at its end (like adding "dle")

If youd want to see more meaning in it, assume that 'h' stands for "haluda" (rust), i.e. the language used for this project.


## Build prerequisites:
- Rust (WASM builder)
- Python3 (for listening on localhost:8080)


## Build / Run:
Run the file `COMPILE_AND_LAUNCH.sh`.

It installs Rust-WASM, compiles, creates a 'web/' dir and copies files into it, and runs the app on localhost:8080
  (Running shell scripts blindly is ill-advised; verify by reading the shell-script's contents)
